## 💡 Senior-Level Impact & Contributions

My experience focuses on driving architectural improvements and delivering scalable solutions:

* **Architectural Unification:** Collaborated to implement a unified architecture using **NX** and **Module Federation**, establishing a shared UI component library. This standardized development and promoted component reuse across teams.
* **Legacy Modernization:** Led the strategic refactoring and migration of large, monolithic legacy systems (like JSP) into modern, modular **React** applications, improving application performance, maintainability, and user experience.
* **Quality & Standards:** **Adopted and integrated robust development practices**, including **TDD** and full test coverage with **Cypress** E2E testing, ensuring deployment stability.
* **Full Stack Context:** Experienced in end-to-end feature delivery, working with **Node.js/Express** and various databases (MongoDB, MySQL) to ensure effective data integration and API consumption.
